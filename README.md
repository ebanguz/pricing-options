## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   BEM methodology
-   SCSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first project using SCSS, and a convention of Sass called "7-1 pattern". Even though I did not fully implemented, that was the structure used.

### Useful resources

-   [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - This helped me getting to know more the preprocessor.

-   [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing website for documentation of CSS and web in general.
